# This is WLM team solution of hackaton 24.11.2023 - 25.11.2023 human trafficking

# Task:

Objective: Create a basic prototype incorporating the use of ML/AI tools to assist in reporting on human trafficking.
Judging Criteria:
Relevance (25p): Creative use of ML/AI techniques in addressing the issue of human trafficking, demonstrating an understanding of the relevant technologies.
Prototype Development (25p): The development of a functional prototype that showcases the proposed ML/AI solution.
Technical Execution (25p): The quality, clarity, efficiency and ease of use of the tool created during the hackathon.
Versatility and Adaptability (15p): The potential of the tool to be adapted for various types of journalistic investigations, demonstrating its utility in diverse reporting contexts beyond just human trafficking.
Impact Potential in Journalism (10p): The tool's potential effectiveness in aiding journalistic efforts against human trafficking.

## To start this project part of project after cloning this repositiry,you will need:

### 1st step:

create venv(virtual enviroments) using command: `python -m venv venv `

### 2st step:

activate venv using command: `.\venv\Scripts\activate` for windows

and `source venv/bin/activate` for mac

### 3rd step:

Install all modules using command `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 4th step:

Run project from main.py

## !!! This is only tiny backend of our project which helps us to display data and work with our machine

### For starting fronend you will need to go to `https://github.com/scott1C/hackaton-wlm-site`

### Step 1:

after clonning, `npm i`/`yarn add`/`pnpm i`

### Step 2:

Start you backend then run `npm run dev` for dev version
`npm run build` for creating optimized build

## The machine Learning is create in google colab, If you want to do same machine learninig or check how we trained our machine check it here
